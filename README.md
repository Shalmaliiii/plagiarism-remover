## How does this work? 
Fundamentally, the way a plagiarism checker works is, it identifies content similarity matches. 
That is, the software scans a database of crawled content and identifies the text components and 
then compares it to the components, or content, of other work. Like a search engine, if you enter in a keyword 
the software scans documents, to find instances of that word. 
However, it is easy to surpass a non-advanced plagiarism software by modifying instances of some characters, without rephrasing.
In this way, we make sure that the changes are non-detectable to human eye, but not for plagiarism softwares.
Even a 100% plagiarised text, will give 97%-100% unique result after running it through a simple code.

#### To test it out, follow the 2 simple steps given below :
1. Paste the plagiarised text in the textbox.
2. Download the .txt file, which contains plagiarism free text.
